# African Data Layer x Kasi Insight
## Strategic Feedback One-Pager (Meeting: Thursday, February 26, 2026)

**Audience:** Yannick Lefang (Founder & CEO, Kasi Insight)  
**Primary goal of this meeting:** Get a candid operator-level assessment on viability, what to fix, and whether we should continue, refine, or pivot.  
**Not the goal:** Asking for investment in this meeting.

### 1) One-Line Thesis
African Data Layer (ADL) is building trusted, real-time, ground-truth infrastructure for essential services (pharmacies, fuel stations, mobile money ...), starting in Bonamoussadi and designed to scale city-by-city.

### 2) Problem
Teams operating in African cities still make decisions with stale or incomplete last-mile data on service availability, quality, and reliability.

### 3) What We Built So Far
- Mobile-first field capture workflow.
- Event-based data model  so every update is traceable.
- Data quality controls at ingestion (photo/location checks, validation, geofence).
- Offline-first queue for low-connectivity field operations.
- Admin review workflow with forensic indicators.

### 4) Current Readiness Snapshot
- Working MVP (web mobile app + API + auth + admin queue + analytics + offline sync).
- Bonamoussadi curated dataset in model.
- Scope architecture supports local to national expansion (admin-controlled scope).

### 5) What Is Validated vs Not Yet Validated
**Validated**
- We can collect, validate, and review data in constrained field conditions.
- We can maintain event history and data provenance.

**Not yet validated**
- Repeatable demand from paying B2B customers.
- Best initial buyer segment and pricing model.
- Speed/cost to scale operations while keeping data quality high.

### 6) Why We Want Yannick's Judgment
Kasi has strong experience turning African market signals into decision products. We want direct feedback on:
- Whether this is a real standalone business.
- Which customer wedge to prioritize first.
- What to cut, keep, or pivot in the current approach.

### 7) Questions We Want Him To Answer
1. If you were us, would you continue on this path as-is, or pivot now?
2. Which first customer segment would you target and why?
3. Is this better positioned as a product company, a data service, or a hybrid?
4. What proof points are missing before we should invest more time and money?
5. What would make this clearly non-viable in the next 60-90 days?
6. Which KPI would you track weekly to judge if this is working?
7. Which part of our current stack/approach looks overbuilt or underbuilt?
8. What is the strongest go-to-market path from your experience in this region?
9. Should we narrow to one vertical first (pharmacy, fuel, or mobile money)?
10. What would your 30-day plan be if you were in our seat?

### 8) Decision Framework (What We Will Use After His Feedback)
**Continue current direction** if he confirms strong wedge + realistic GTM path.  
**Refine/narrow** if value is real but scope is too broad or buyer is unclear.  
**Pivot** if the market need is weak, economics are broken, or trust moat is not defensible enough.

## In-Room Flow (30 Minutes)
1. **0-3 min:** Context + explicit objective: "We want brutally honest viability feedback, not funding."
2. **3-8 min:** Product walkthrough focused on trust and field execution.
3. **8-13 min:** What is validated vs what is uncertain.
4. **13-22 min:** Guided strategic questions (viability, wedge, GTM, pivot triggers).
5. **22-27 min:** Ask him to rank top 3 priorities and top 3 risks.
6. **27-30 min:** Confirm immediate next-step recommendation and decision criteria.

## Close Script
"We are treating this as a go/no-go strategy review. Based on what you saw, what should we do in the next 30 days: continue, narrow, or pivot, and why?"

## 48-Hour Follow-Up Workflow
1. Send a short recap with his explicit recommendations and our interpretation.
2. Convert feedback into a 30-day experiment plan with owners and metrics.
3. Share a decision checkpoint date to review whether we continue, refine, or pivot.
